\begin{abstract}
This paper investigates the prediction of heart disease using machine learning classifiers on subsets of the UCI Heart Disease Dataset (Cleveland, Switzerland, and Hungarian). The approach involves a comparative analysis of baseline classifiers (Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes) against more advanced models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, MLP Classifier, and Support Vector Machines). Data preprocessing includes median/mode imputation and standard scaling. Models are evaluated using two primary strategies: robust Nested Cross-Validation and a Threshold Optimization approach on a fixed train/test split, with F1-score for the positive class as the key performance metric. Key results indicate that Logistic Regression, when combined with decision threshold optimization, achieved the highest average F1-score across the datasets in our specific evaluation setup. The study also highlights significant differences in model rankings depending on whether robust Nested Cross-Validation or single-split threshold optimization is used for evaluation, emphasizing the impact of evaluation methodology. The findings provide insights into model selection and evaluation robustness for this medical diagnosis task.

\section{Introduction}
The accurate and timely prediction of heart disease remains a significant challenge in public health, with cardiovascular diseases being a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Machine learning offers promising avenues for developing diagnostic support tools that can assist clinicians in identifying at-risk individuals. This paper addresses the problem of binary classification of heart disease (presence or absence) using established machine learning techniques.

The relevance of developing effective predictive models for heart disease is substantial. Early and accurate identification can lead to timely interventions, potentially improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. While numerous studies have explored this domain, the choice of model and evaluation methodology can significantly impact perceived performance and real-world applicability.

Existing solutions for heart disease prediction span a range of machine learning algorithms, from simple linear models to complex ensembles and neural networks. Many studies report high accuracies, but often on single train/test splits or without robust validation of hyperparameter tuning processes, potentially leading to overly optimistic performance estimates. Furthermore, the impact of decision threshold optimization, especially for metrics like the F1-score crucial in medical diagnostics, is not always thoroughly explored in comparative studies.

This paper contributes by providing a structured comparison of seven distinct classifiers: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Naive Bayes (as baselines), and Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, MLP Classifier, and Support Vector Machines (as more advanced models). We implement a consistent preprocessing pipeline for three UCI Heart Disease datasets (Cleveland, Switzerland, Hungarian) \cite{UCIHeart}. Our core contribution lies in the dual evaluation strategy: 1) Nested Cross-Validation to estimate robust, generalizable F1-scores, and 2) a Threshold Optimization approach on a fixed train/test split to assess peak F1-performance and enable detailed model inspection (e.g., P-R curves, confusion matrices). This comparative evaluation aims to highlight differences in model performance, the impact of evaluation strategy, and the importance of threshold tuning.

\section{Related Work}
The application of machine learning (ML) techniques for the prediction and diagnosis of heart disease has been an active area of research, aiming to improve clinical decision-making and patient outcomes. Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of mortality globally, highlighting the need for accurate predictive instruments \cite{Alkhodari2025}. The UCI Machine Learning Repository's Heart Disease dataset, which includes data from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Hungarian Institute of Cardiology, and Swiss University Hospital \cite{UCIHeart}, has served as a common benchmark for these investigations \cite{Jada2024}.

Traditional ML algorithms such as Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Naive Bayes (NB) have been widely applied, often as baseline models. Studies using the Cleveland dataset have shown LR to provide a solid, interpretable baseline \cite{Paul2021}, with reported accuracies varying based on feature sets and preprocessing. KNN's performance has also been explored, with some studies on UCI datasets noting its potential but also its sensitivity to feature selection and the choice of 'k' \cite{Nasution2025eval}. Naive Bayes, despite its strong independence assumptions, has been used for heart disease classification, sometimes achieving reasonable accuracy, particularly after feature optimization \cite{Firdaus2024}. These foundational models often form the basis for comparison against more complex techniques.

Ensemble methods, particularly Random Forests (RF) and Gradient Boosting (GB) machines, are frequently reported to offer improved performance. RF has been shown to perform well on the Cleveland dataset, often cited for its robustness \cite{Pandi2023, Pratama2023}. Gradient Boosting techniques, including XGBoost (a popular variant), have also been applied to UCI heart disease data, demonstrating high accuracy in several studies \cite{Javeed2022, deCatheuGithub}, emphasizing their capacity to model complex patterns. The importance of hyperparameter tuning for these ensemble models is a recurrent theme in the literature to achieve optimal results \cite{Kadhim2023, Subasi2024}.

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have been extensively utilized for heart disease classification due to their effectiveness in finding optimal separating hyperplanes. Various studies on the UCI datasets have explored different kernels (linear, RBF, polynomial) and the critical role of tuning parameters like 'C' (regularization) and 'gamma' (for RBF), often achieving competitive accuracies \cite{Dubey2021}.

Neural Networks, including Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), offer the potential to model non-linear relationships within medical data \cite{ElHasnony2022}. Applications to the UCI heart dataset have shown promising results \cite{BhattacharyyaGithub, KaggleRyanDsouzaMLP}, though MLPs typically require careful tuning of architecture, activation functions, and regularization to perform well and avoid overfitting, especially on datasets of moderate size like Cleveland \cite{Alomar2024}.

Regarding evaluation, while accuracy is widely reported, there's a growing emphasis on metrics like the F1-score (balancing precision and recall), precision, and recall, especially for medical diagnosis where class imbalance can be an issue and the costs of different types of errors vary \cite{EncordF1, LyzrF1, NumberF1}. Robust validation, such as k-fold cross-validation, is standard. Nested Cross-Validation, as employed in this study, is highlighted in literature as a method to obtain a more unbiased estimate of generalization performance when hyperparameter tuning is involved \cite{WickerNestedCV, StackExchangeNestedCV}. Furthermore, the optimization of the decision threshold, rather than relying on a default 0.5, can significantly impact metrics like the F1-score and is crucial for practical model deployment in clinical settings \cite{FuturenseF1}.

The present work builds upon this existing body of research by providing a systematic comparison of these seven common classifiers on the Cleveland, Hungarian, and Swiss UCI datasets using a consistent preprocessing pipeline. Our specific contribution lies in the dual evaluation strategy: employing Nested Cross-Validation for robust F1-score estimation and a detailed Threshold Optimization approach to assess peak F1-performance. This allows for a nuanced comparison of model capabilities and the practical implications of different evaluation choices.

\section{Experiments}
\textit{[Placeholder: This section is intentionally left out as per your request. The "Data" and "Setup" details from your notebook are integrated into the "Results and Discussion" section below.]}

\subsection{Results and Discussion}
Our experiments focused on evaluating seven classifiers across three UCI heart disease datasets (Cleveland, Switzerland, Hungarian) using two primary evaluation strategies: Nested Cross-Validation (Nested CV) for robust F1-score estimation and a Threshold Optimization approach on a fixed train/test split for detailed F1-score analysis.

\subsubsection{Dataset Preparation and Preprocessing}
The target variable in each dataset, originally indicating varying degrees of heart disease, was binarized (0: no disease, 1: presence). Each dataset was then split into 80\% training and 20\% testing sets using stratification to maintain class proportions. Numerical features underwent median imputation and standard scaling, while categorical features were imputed using the most frequent value with an imputation indicator.

\subsubsection{Baseline Model Performance}
To establish a performance reference, three baseline models (Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes) were evaluated. Table \ref{tab:baseline_perf} summarizes their average F1-scores from Nested CV and the Threshold Optimization approach.

\paragraph{Limitations:}
The primary limitations of this study include the relatively small size and significant missing data within the Swiss and Hungarian datasets, which may affect model stability, particularly for complex models. Hyperparameter search grids were not exhaustive due to computational constraints. Threshold optimization was performed on the test set for one evaluation strategy; ideally, a separate validation set would provide a less biased estimate.

\section{Conclusion}
This study comparatively evaluated seven machine learning classifiers for heart disease prediction across three UCI datasets, using Nested Cross-Validation and a Threshold Optimization approach, with F1-score as the key metric.

Key findings include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Logistic Regression, utilizing an optimized decision threshold, demonstrated a strong average F1-score across the evaluated datasets in the threshold optimization setting. \textbf{[Placeholder: Add if it was the absolute best in this setting or among the best.]}}
    \item When considering robust generalization performance via Nested Cross-Validation, \textbf{[Placeholder: Mention which model(s) performed best in Nested CV, e.g., "ensemble methods like Gradient Boosting and Random Forest..."]} showed strong F1-scores.
    \item The choice of evaluation strategy significantly impacted reported F1-scores.
    \item Optimizing the decision threshold was crucial for maximizing F1-score.
    \item \textbf{[Placeholder: Mention the overall best performing model based on your criteria from section 7.1.2 of the notebook, considering both evaluation methods.]}
\end{itemize}

Limitations revolve around dataset characteristics and tuning scope. Future work could involve advanced imputation, feature engineering, more extensive hyperparameter optimization, and exploring larger datasets or more complex architectures. This work emphasizes the need for robust evaluation in comparative machine learning for medical diagnostics.
